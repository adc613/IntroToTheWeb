## Personalize your website

Ideas for what your could add to your site:

* Make it a portfolio site and add a short bio about your self, pictures, and
  links to social media accounts.
* Experiment more with CSS, change the font styles and colors, add a background
  (bonus if you make the background a gradient), and/or try the **[hardest problem in
  computer science](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1340410524324880388)**
  centering text horizontally and vertically on the page.
* Checkout [Codepen](http://codepen.io) to see cool example of what people are
  building using HTML/CSS (and a little bit of JavaScript).

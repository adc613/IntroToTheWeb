## At home challenge (*google.com is your best friend*)

### Customize your editor

VS Code is highly customizable and you can add all sorts of themes. Try
personalizing your VS Code setup by googling ["best vscode  themes"](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+vscode+themes&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS947US947&sxsrf=ALeKk02w2FX2inb7S4ZIXX5j2XBhjoaa-Q%3A1617329832091&ei=qH5mYOaCBcG4tAa5rJCYDw&oq=best+vscode+themes&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECcyBAgjECcyBQgAELEDMgIIADICCAAyBwgAEIcCEBQyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgcIABBHELADUJ0JWJ0JYPwPaAJwAngAgAE6iAFokgEBMpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwjm9oCRv97vAhVBHM0KHTkWBPMQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)

### Personalize your website

Ideas for what your could add to your site:

* Make it a portfolio site and add a short bio about your self, pictures, and
  links to social media accounts.
* Experiment more with CSS, change the font styles and colors, add a background
  (bonus if you make the background a gradient), and/or try the **[hardest problem in
  computer science](https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1340410524324880388)**
  centering text horizontally and vertically on the page.
* Checkout [Codepen](http://codepen.io) to see cool example of what people are
  building using HTML/CSS (and a little bit of JavaScript).

# Our first React app

Creating a React app is very simple. There's an awesome tool called `create-react-app`
that pretty much does everything for us.

## Initializing React app

You'll want to do these steps in a new folder

1. `npx create-react-app codenext --template typescript`
1. `npm run start`

If done right the browser should magically open and you'll see a spinning React
logo. If not, the terminal should print out a URL (ex: http://localhost:3000) that
can preview your site at.

## Making changes

1. Open the new `src/App.tsx` file and Try changing the contents of a paragraph.
1. Save your file
1. Watch the browser refresh
